# Model Testing
This section of the repo is used to test different object detection models and benchmark them on competing architectures. Note that this section is used primarily for testing, and that the final models and architectures will be implemented under the ROS section.

## Notes
The YOLOv3 weights for the COCO dataset aren't included in this repo due to the size.   
They can be downloaded using: `wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights`  
<br>
Additionally, the dataset is left out of this repo due to size contraints. Contact Sam Cantor if you would
like acess.
