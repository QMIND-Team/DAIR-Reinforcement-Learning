## Notes
The YOLOv3 weights for the COCO dataset aren't included in this repo due to the size.   
They can be downloaded using: `wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights`

Additionally, the dataset is left out of this repo due to size contraints. Contact Sam Cantor if you would
like acess.
