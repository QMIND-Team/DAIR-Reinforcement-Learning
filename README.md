# DAIR-Perception

Welcome to the official QMIND DAIR-Perception Team!  
<br>
Our goal for this year was to design an enhanced robot perception system that supports computer vision and deep
learning to aid in autonomous driving . With real-time object detection, our software will be able to control a
Turtlebot3 to correctly navigate and seek out specified objects in a room. The system implements Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with LiDAR & camera sensing to improve object detection in dynamic environments.
As part of QMIND's Division of AI Research (DAIR), exploration and development on new methods for custom datasets,
deep neural networks, robot operation and control systems are vital to developing an efficient end-to-end machine learning system.
