    "Git is an extremely useful and powerful tool to be used in an agile team, and will be one of the most important resources used on this team. Although we will only be using the basic features of Git, it is important to know how it works on a low-level so that we can effectively and safely navigate our repository. It may seem daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it I promise Git will be your best friend :)\n",
